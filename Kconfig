            - grok-3-latest: Current generation (balanced, recommended)
            - grok-3-mini-latest: Small, efficient (best for ESP32)
            - grok-3-fast-latest: Fast responses (low latency)
            - grok-2-vision-latest: Vision capabilities

                Maximum size for API responses.
                
                Recommendations:
                - 2048: Minimal (short responses only)
                - 8192: Recommended (most conversations)
                - 16384: Large (long-form content)
                
                Larger values allow longer responses but use more memory.
                Each buffer consumes this amount of heap.

                More buffers allow concurrent requests from multiple tasks,

                simultaneously. When disabled, tools are called sequentially.
